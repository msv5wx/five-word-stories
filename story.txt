She went for a walk and tripped on a rock. She got up and was bleeding.  
Luckily, she had a band-aid with her. She placed the band-aid on her knee. 
Then she started walking again. She walked until she reached a lake. She 
decided to go for a swim. The water was very cold. She got out quickly and
 dried off. The warm sun dried her clothes quickly. She decided to get ice
cream. She ordered her favorite scoop from the ice cream truck. It was cookies
 and cream.
